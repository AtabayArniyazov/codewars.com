		<h1>Fibonacci, Tribonacci and friends</h1>
		<p>If you have completed the Tribonacci sequence kata, you would know by now that mister Fibonacci has at least a bigger brother. If not, give it a quick look to get how things work.</p>

		<p>Well, time to expand the family a little more: think of a Quadribonacci starting with a signature of 4 elements and each following element is the sum of the 4 previous, a Pentabonacci (well Cinquebonacci would probably sound a bit more italian, but it would also sound really awful) with a signature of 5 elements and each following element is the sum of the 5 previous, and so on.</p>

		<p>Well, guess what? You have to build a Xbonacci function that takes a signature of X elements - and remember each next element is the sum of the last X elements - and returns the first n elements of the so seeded sequence.</p>

		<p>Xbonacci([1,1,1,1],10)==[1,1,1,1,4,7,13,25,49,94]<br>
		Xbonacci([0,0,0,0,1],10)==[0,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,8,16]<br>
		Xbonacci([1,0,0,0,0,0,1],10)==[1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,6]</p>
