		<h1>Square and Cubic Factors</h1>
		<p>Task:<br>

		Your job here is to implement a function factors, which takes a number n, and outputs an array of arrays comprised of two parts, sq and cb. The part sq will contain all the numbers that, when squared, yield a number which is a factor of n, while the cb part will contain all the numbers that, when cubed, yield a number which is a factor of n. Discard all 1s from both arrays.<br>

		Both sq and cb should be sorted in ascending order.<br>

		What it looks like:<br>

		factors(Number) #=> [<br>
		  sq (all the numbers that can be squared to give a factor of n) : Array,<br>
		  cb (all the numbers that can be cubed   to give a factor of n) : Array<br>
		]
		Some examples:<br>

		factors(1) #=> [[], []]<br>
		  # ones are discarded from outputs<br>

		factors(4) #=> [[2], []]<br>
		  # 2 squared is 4;   4 is a factor of 4<br>

		factors(16) #=> [[2, 4], [2]]<br>
		  # 2 squared is  4;  4 is a factor of 16<br>
		  # 4 squared is 16; 16 is a factor of 16<br>
		  # 2 cubed is    8;  8 is a factor of 16<br>

		factors(81) #=> [[3, 9], [3]]<br>
		  # 3 squared is  9;  9 is a factor of 81<br>
		  # 9 squared is 81; 81 is a factor of 81<br>
		  # 3 cubed is   27; 27 is a factor of 81<br>
