		<h1>Plural</h1>
		<p>We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. This would be useful when printing out a string such as 5 minutes, 14 apples, or 1 sun.<br>

		You only need to worry about english grammar rules for this kata, where anything that isn't singular (one of something), it is plural (not one of something).<br>
		All values will be positive integers or floats, or zero.</p>
