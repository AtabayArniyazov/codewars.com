		<h1>Playing with digits</h1>
		<p>Some numbers have funny properties. For example:</p>

		<p>89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1<br>
		  695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2<br>
		46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51</p>

		<p>Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n. In other words:</p>

		<p>Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k</p>

		<p>If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.</p>

		<p>Note: n, p will always be given as strictly positive integers.</p>

		<p>digPow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1<br>
		digPow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k<br>
		digPow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2<br>
		digPow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51</p>
