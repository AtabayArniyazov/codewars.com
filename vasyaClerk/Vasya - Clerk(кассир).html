		<h1>Vasya - Clerk(кассир)</h1>
		<p>The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge 	 line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. A "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.</p>

		<p>Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.</p>

		<p>Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?</p>

		<p>Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change. Otherwise return NO.</p>

		<p>Examples:</p>

		<p>tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES<br>
		   tickets([25, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
