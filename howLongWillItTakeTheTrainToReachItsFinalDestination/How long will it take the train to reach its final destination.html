		<h1>How long will it take the train to reach its final destination</h1>
		<p>You have just boarded a train when your friend texts you to ask how long it will take your train to reach the stop where they're waiting for you.<br>

		Assuming that you know the distance in km and the train's average speed in km/h, let your friend know how long it will take the train to reach their stop, rounding the time to the nearest half hour.<br>

		As you are sending your reply via text, you should specify the time using numbers rather than words.<br>

		For example, given a distance of 80 km and an average speed of 20 km/h:<br>

		reachDestination(80, 20);<br>

		Your function should return:<br>

		'The train will be there in 4 hours.'<br>

		Hint: Keep in mind that the returned sentence needs to follow basic grammatical rules.</p>
