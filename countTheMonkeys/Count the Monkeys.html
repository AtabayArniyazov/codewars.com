		<h1>Count the Monkeys</h1>
		<p>You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.<br>

		As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.<br>

		For example, if n = 10:<br>

		return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</p>
